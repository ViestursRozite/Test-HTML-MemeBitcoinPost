        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When I was younger&nbsp;I used to be broke, depressed and Bitcoin-less.</p>
        <p>I'd literally see history happening before me without beeing able to participate...</p>
        <p>I'd give Twitter a little peek and hear of people riding the green line to the moon!</p>
        <p>It annoyed me to no end.</p>
        <p>I think you know why...</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>You've taught about giving Bitcoin a go but there's an issue...</p>
        <p>It takes like a Google&nbsp;search or something and man that's jus too much effort to exert.</p>
        <p>One Spambot tells you to sign up using it's refferal link, but you wouldn't fall for such self centered scammy behaivior!</p>
        <p>You've experienced that&nbsp;overwhelming feeling because of all the du-dilligence you know you should do when choosing where to trade Cryptos.</p>
        <p>How are you supposed to do that when you know you will have to God forbid take Time to Read or even worse make rational decisions about picking a brocker based on thir fees.</p>
        <p>You end up not doing anything so much that you don't even see any real progress.</p>
        <p>Now that I am an experianced Bitcoin Millionare.Man, I uh... make 200 000$ trades on the daily! I can tell you that a lot of people promoting Coinbase do so because of the 10$ refferal bonus they get in return! They promote stuff based on personal gain NOT the best place for trade.</p>
        <p>That's why you see everyone promoting the same 2-3 sites - It's refferals, not useful information!</p>
        <p><strong>Luckly for you Im somewhat of a crypto brockerage expert myself.</strong></p>
